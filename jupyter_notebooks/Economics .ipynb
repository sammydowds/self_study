    "1. Starting with this: https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/14/14.01SC/MIT14_01SCF11_rttext.pdf\n",
    "    - as a note, this is from 2009. Have concepts changed since then?\n",
    "    - Interesting point, we are in a similar financial situation. Could be more applicable?\n",
    "2. Watched a few of these too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ez10ADR_gM"

    "# 1: Economics: The Study of Choice \n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1: Definitions \n",
    "\n",
    "### Economics boils down to the study of choices. \n",
    "- Individually: Do we want to make better grades? More time to relax? More time to watch movies? Better grades probably requires less of the latter. \n",
    "- Society: Do we want a cleaner environment? Do we want faster economics growth? Efforts to clean up the environment might hinder the second. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Economics is a social science of how people choose among the alternatives available to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Making a choice includes 3 central ideas of economics:\n",
    "1. __Scarcity__ - \"our unlimited wants are continually colliding with the limits of our resources....\". To test if a good is scarce, determine if it has alternative uses. Example: Space was a free good when we just looked at it, now it has alternatives than to just look at. \n",
    "2. __Choice__\n",
    "3. __Opportunity Cost__ - the best alternative foregone in making any choice. For instance, I could be playing video games instead of reading this text book - and the best alternative I am foregoing is the enjoyment of playing that video game. As a note - this is not just purely _money_ spent. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Every Economy should answer these questions in regards to Scarcity: \n",
    "1. What should be produced?\n",
    "2. How should it be produced?\n",
    "3. For whom should it be produced for?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2: Economics as a field of Study \n",
    "### What separates an economist from an anthropoligist, psychologist, sociologist, etc? \n",
    "1. focus on role of opportunity cost in analysis of choices \n",
    "2. assume people maximize value of objectives, with objectives being in one owns self interest\n",
    "    - \"self-interest\" may mean gaining satisfaction from helping others, it is not to reflect greed only\n",
    "3. assume individuals pay attention to the small changes in levels of activity \n",
    "\n",
    "### Choices are made at the Margin. \n",
    "The margin is a level of activity. A choice at the margin is the decision to do a little more or a little less. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Curtailing water consumption. To induce conserving water, raise the price. A common response is that this has no effect because water is a necessity. However, individuals do not make the choice to either drink water or not drink water - you have to. The choice then is to consume either a little more or a little less. \n",
    "\n",
    "The __three central ideas of economics__ at the margin can be found in two broad areas of economics: __Microeconomics and Macroeconomics__. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Microeconomics and Macroeconomics\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Microeconomics__\n",
    "    - Focuses on the choices made by individual decision-making units in the economy (consumers and firms), and the impact those choices have on individual markets. \n",
    "- __Macroeconomics__\n",
    "    - Focuses on the impact of choices on the total level of economic activity. \n",

    "# 2: Confronting Scarcity: Choices in Production \n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1: Factors of Production \n",
    "\n",
    "### Core of Production: \n",
    "1. __Labor__ - Employees, and those would like to be. \n",
    "2. __Capital__ - product that factors into the production of other goods or services. The first example of capital could be when tools were created back in the stone ages to hunt, butcher, etc. Capital can also be intellectual discoveries, software, etc. \n",
    "    - Office Buildings\n",
    "    - Machinery\n",
    "    - Tools \n",
    "3. __Natural Resources__ - two essential characteristics:\n",
    "   1. No human effort has gone into making it\n",
    "   2. Can be used for the production of other goods \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Side note: This section on capital has been the coolest thus far. Provides a way to structure products that are used in production - which particularily relates directly to my industry (industrial robotics). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition: An entreprenuer operates within a market economy to reorganize the factors of production in order to profit. \n",
    "So by definition if you have written software that factors into the production of goods or services, and assuming you will be profiting from that - you are an entrepreneur. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2: Production Posibilities Curves \n",
    "\n",
    "### This is a graph of possibilities of goods and services and economy can produce. In this book, it only compares two at a time. It also assumes that the quantities of production and the tech available are fixed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructing a curve: \n",
    "\n",
    "Opportunity cost can be calculated by the aboslute value of the slop of each curve below. In this case, the number of skis that must be given up to produce snowboards. As the slope gets steeper, so does the opportunity cost. \n",
